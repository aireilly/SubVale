# Vale 2.0.0

The focus of this package is now supporting Vale's desktop application,
Vale Server (https://errata.ai/vale-server/). This allows for better
integration with Vale and its resources than we could achieve through
the CLI alone. Some of the new features include support for the Vale Dashboard
and project-based configuration.

If you'd like to continue using Sublime Text with the Vale command-line
tool, you can do so by installing the SublimeLinter package:
